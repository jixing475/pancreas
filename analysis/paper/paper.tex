\hypertarget{using-r-markdown}{%
\section{USING R MARKDOWN}\label{using-r-markdown}}

Some examples of commonly used markdown syntax are listed below, to help you get started.

\hypertarget{cross-references}{%
\subsection{Cross-references}\label{cross-references}}

For portability between different output formats, use the syntax introduced by \emph{bookdown}, such as \texttt{(\textbackslash{}\#label)} for labels and \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(label)} for cross-references. The following sections provide examples of referencing tables, figures, and equations.

\hypertarget{citations}{%
\subsection{Citations}\label{citations}}

You can include references in a standard Bibtex file. The name of this file is given in the header of the markdown document (in our case it is \emph{sample.bib}). References to entries in the Bibtex file are made using square brackets and use an @ plus the key for the entry you are referencing \citep{Smith:2012qr}. You can combine multiple entries by separating them with a semi-colon \citep{Smith:2012qr, Smith:2013jd}.
The default bibliography style uses numerical citations. For superscript or author-year citations set the header metadata field \texttt{natbiboptions} to either \texttt{super} or \texttt{round}, respectively.

\hypertarget{code-chunks}{%
\subsection{Code chunks}\label{code-chunks}}

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{:}\DecValTok{10}
\NormalTok{x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
\end{verbatim}

If you specify a figure caption to a code chunk using the chunk option \texttt{fig.cap}, the plot will be automatically labeled and numbered. The figure label is generated from the label of the code chunk by prefixing it with \texttt{fig:}, e.g., see Figure \ref{fig:plot}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(x)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{paper_files/figure-latex/plot-1} 

}

\caption{A caption to our sample plot.}\label{fig:plot}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{tables}{%
\subsection{Tables}\label{tables}}

Markdown syntax tends to lack some of the more sophisticated formatting features available in LaTeX, so you may need to edit the tables later to get the desired format.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Caption to table.}
\centering
\begin{tabledata}{@{}lll@{}}
\header First name & Last Name & Grade\\
\row John & Doe & 7.5\\
\row Richard & Miles & 2\\
\end{tabledata}
\end{table}

Just like figures, tables with captions will also be numbered and can be referenced. Captions are entered as a paragraph beginning with the string ``Table:'' (or just ``:''), which may appear either before or after the table. A label for the table should appear in the beginning of the caption in the form of \texttt{(\textbackslash{}\#tab:label)}, e.g., see Table \ref{tab:table}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{\label{tab:table} A table with text justification.}
\centering
\begin{tabledata}{@{}lcr@{}}
\header First name & Last Name & Grade\\
\row John & Doe & 7.5\\
\row Richard & Miles & 2\\
\end{tabledata}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{figures}{%
\subsection{Figures}\label{figures}}

You can include static figures (i.e.~no generated by code) using the \texttt{include\_graphics()} function from the \textbf{knitr} package, in a standard code chunk.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{knitr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{include_graphics}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{'frog.jpg'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{frog} 

}

\caption{Your figure legend goes here; it should be succinct, while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations.}\label{fig:frog-picture}
\end{figure}

You can again use the \texttt{fig.cap} option to provide the figure caption, and reference the image based on the code chunk label. You can also use options such as \texttt{fig.align} and \texttt{fig.width} to adjust the position and size of the image within the final document, e.g.~Figure \ref{fig:frog-picture} is a frog.

Alternatively, you can use the standard markdown syntax like so:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth,height=\textheight]{frog.jpg}
\caption{This is a smaller version of the same picture, inserted using the standard markdown syntax}
\end{figure}

Please give figures appropriate filenames, e.g.: figure1.pdf, figure2.png.

Figure legends should briefly describe the key messages of the figure such that the figure can stand alone from the main text. However, all figures should also be discussed in the article text. Each legend should have a concise title of no more than 15 words. The legend itself should be succinct, while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations. Avoid lengthy descriptions of methods.

For any figures reproduced from another publication (as long as appropriate permission has been obtained from the copyright holder - see under the heading `Submission'), please include a line in the legend to state that: `This figure has been reproduced with kind permission from {[}include original publication citation{]}'.

\hypertarget{mathematics}{%
\subsection{Mathematics}\label{mathematics}}

You can use LaTeX syntax to typeset mathematical expressions. Let \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with \(\text{E}[X_i] = \mu\) and \(\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty\), and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as \(n\) approaches infinity, the random variables \(\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)\) converge in distribution to a normal \(\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\).

To number and refer to equations, put them in the equation environments and assign labels to them, as for Equation \eqref{eq:binom}.

\begin{equation}
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  \label{eq:binom}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{lists}{%
\subsection{Lists}\label{lists}}

You can make ordered lists

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Like this,
\item
  and like this.
\end{enumerate}

or bullet points

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Like this,
\item
  and like this.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Use indentation

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      for sub-items
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
